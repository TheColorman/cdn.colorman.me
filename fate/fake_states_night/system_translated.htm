          <p align="left">The game is text-based, kind of like <span class="tlnote" title="I don't know what this (『●道２』) is a reference to"><em>***dou 2</em></span>! If the "2" was a "1", we'd have to censor that too, and then none of this would make any sense!</p>
          <p align="left">You could say that it's like Fate/holl*w ataraxia, except that instead of looping, all the choices are available to you from the beginning!</p>
          <p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0;">Be careful, though - even though you're the one making the choices, that doesn't mean you'll be the main character at the center of the plot. Depending on how things turn out, the Holy Grail War could end with you playing the role of Innocent Bystander A!</p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">To fill the gap left by the loss of the Saber class, <em>you</em> are able to use the power of five Heroic Spirits! Perseus, Jason, Scathach, the Hydra, and more! From ten or so different types of Servants, take your pick of five!</p></td>
      <td>In a single game, you have just 30 minutes for which you can summon your Heroic Spirits!<br>
        Each Heroic Spirit is powerful enough to stand on equal footing with any other Servant. You can summon them all at once, or you can summon each one separately, for just five minutes at a time. If you carefully consider the situation in Snowfield, and select the best, most suitable Servants, you could even attain the Holy Grail!<br></td>

          In this game, Gilgamesh remains the most powerful servant. Nonetheless, if you catch him with his guard down and use your Command Spells to summon all five of your Servants at once, ...?</p></td>

        <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>
          Each Servant possesses a "Noble Phantasm", a special move of sorts.<br>
          If you activate a Noble Phantasm without making any errors, you are certain to achieve victory. However, not only do different Noble Phantasms have distinct affinities; they also require much magical energy. If you overuse Noble Phantasms, the mere 30 minutes for which you can materialize your Servants will decrease yet further. Before using a Noble Phantasm, you should check the status screen to make sure you have enough magical energy.</p></td>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><strong>・ How many Noble Phantasms does Perseus have?!</strong></p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>
          Normally, a Servant has one or two Noble Phantasms. But you can summon Perseus, who can use the bag Kibisis; a helm to conceal himself; the serpent-slaying scythe Harpe; and so on and so forth - five in all! Since you won't be able to use them all in the 30-minute time limit, it's very important that you choose wisely!</p></td>

          All of the many Masters and Servants have their quirks. In this battle royale, you can't fight head-on and hope to win. From time to time, you'll have to form temporary alliances!</p></td>
      <td>・ Alignment system<br>
        You can't make an alliance with just <em>anybody</em>. What's important are the alignments of your Servants. Lawful, Neutral, Chaotic; Good, Neutral, Evil. Different goals and personalities for all the Servants. But even if they coincide with the player, will it really be that easy to form an alliance?! Even if you do form an alliance, if your goals differ, you could easily be betrayed, so be careful!</td>

          Somebody has a hidden purpose for this Holy Grail War. Perhaps for that reason, there are valuable items hidden all over the place. If you use these items well, you might be able to make progress without expending the time you have available to summon your Servant...</p></td>
      <td>・ A puppet's arm<br>
        It looks like a true human arm, through and through, and yet it is artificial. If you successfully connect it to your body, it seems that you can touch spiritual beings. They say it was made by a <span class="tlnote" title="Hi Touko">puppeteer from Japan</span>, but...?
        <p>・Mana compass<br>
          A compass that points in the direction of the strongest magical energy. If you use it, you'll easily be able to locate hidden Servants. The name of the former owner, "Rin Tohsaka", is inscribed on its back.</p></td>

        <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>
          Servants deplete their magical energy gauge with every action they take. Combat takes a great toll; the use of a Noble Phantasm takes an even greater toll.<br>
          The magical energy gauge replenishes by itself, but if you exhaust your gauge against an enemy Servant, you may have to resort to that worst of options, eating people! Ordinarily, only Servants with either the Chaotic or Evil alignments will choose to do so, but if the Master so desires, he can force his Servant to eat, using a Command Spell!</p></td>

          <p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If you absorb enough magical energy, you might be able to summon your Servants for a longer period of time! But be careful - you might end up forcing your Servant to change alignments.</p>

          There are hot springs in Snowfield. Ordinarily, female servants like Scathach, Scylla, and <span class="tlnote" title="granddaughter of Dong Zhuo">Dong Bai</span> wouldn't want to bathe in the hot springs, but if you use a Command Spell....

Muda is well-known for critically-acclaimed works like <span class="tlnote" title="「借りちゃえ魔法使い」, lit.

          　He got roped into this April Fool's project because of reasons, and wrote about half of the explanation of the game's mechanics. It most definitely wasn't because a certain Narita Nohgo was blubbering about how he wasn't going to make it in time for April Fools' Day,  and it clearly had nothing to do with that certain Nohgo suddenly making Muda help out. And it absolutely, almost certainly, probably, fairly likely, perhaps didn't have anything to do with the fact that Nohgo started writing the explanation of the game mechanics at 10:00 pm on March 31st!</p></td>
